## What is this

Drop a CSV onto a static web page → get a clean chart sized for social media or
print → export PNG/SVG. No upload, no signup, no configuration.

## Who is it for, and what pain does it solve

Someone with a small CSV (sales numbers, survey results, a workout log) who needs a
decent-looking chart for a tweet / IG post / report right now. Current options all
fail them: Excel (ugly defaults, screenshot workflow), RAWGraphs (grammar-of-graphics
learning curve), Datawrapper/Flourish (signup + SVG paywalled), matplotlib (code).

## The small differentiation (一點點差異性)

> Re-anchored 2026-07-06 after a multi-agent review (see DECISIONS): in 2026 the
> "zero-config + named presets + free SVG" trio is largely commodity — multiple free
> tools (ChartLoad, Kanaries, DataToChart…) already bundle it. So that trio is the
> ante, not the wedge.

- **The defensible wedge is privacy / offline / deterministic.** Your data never leaves
  the browser (no upload, no server — verifiable in the Network tab); it works offline
  after first load; and the same CSV always produces the same chart. Neither the hosted
  free tiers nor an LLM ("upload your CSV, make me a chart") can honestly claim all three.
- Zero-config auto-detection, the named export presets (Twitter / IG / A4), and free
  unlimited SVG (Datawrapper and Flourish do gate SVG behind paid plans — verified
  2026-07-04) remain real, differentiating *features* — but they are supporting cast,
  not the headline.
- Nearest config-heavy tool: RAWGraphs — https://github.com/rawgraphs/rawgraphs-app,
  ~9,009★ (verified 2026-07-04) — browser-local like us, but drag-fields-onto-axes.

## Done criteria (v1)

- [ ] Drop/paste a CSV → a sensible default chart renders with ZERO configuration
      (auto-detect: date/time column → line; categories + numbers → bar;
      two numeric columns → scatter)
- [ ] One-click export presets: Twitter card 1200×675, IG post 1080×1080, A4 print —
      PNG and SVG, both free, no watermark
- [ ] Edge cases handled: quoted commas, missing values, >1,000 rows (sample or
      graceful message), non-UTF-8 fallback message
- [ ] 100% client-side: works offline after first load; zero network requests
      carrying user data (verifiable in devtools Network tab)
- [ ] Deploys as a static site on GitHub Pages

## v1.1 — decided 2026-07-06 (after the multi-agent review)

- [ ] **Chart-type override (escape hatch):** a minimal line / bar / scatter toggle so a
      wrong auto-detection isn't a dead end. Default stays auto-detected; scatter is
      disabled when there are <2 numeric columns. This is the ONLY manual control — not a
      field/axis mapping UI.
- [x] Re-anchor positioning on privacy / offline / deterministic (see differentiation
      section + README); free SVG demoted from headline to supporting feature.
- [x] Hardening: Vitest suite incl. an SVG smoke test guarding the canvas2svg pipeline;
      chart.js + canvas2svg pinned to exact versions; CI runs test + build.
- [x] Adoption: one-click sample-data buttons; static README hero (animated GIF still TODO).
- [x] Correctness: line `tension`→0 (no fabricated values); 4-digit `year` column → line.

## Non-goals / Later / Not now

- NO field/axis mapping or chart-type gallery UI (that is RAWGraphs' turf — we lose if we
  compete there). The single line/bar/scatter override above is an escape hatch, NOT field
  configuration; zero-config stays the default.
- No dashboards, no multi-chart, no data storage, no accounts, no analytics, no AI
- Later: color/theme presets, .xlsx input, editable chart title/labels
- Later (surfaced by the review — see DECISIONS): sort categorical bars by value +
  horizontal bars for long labels; aggregate (sum/count) categorical data instead of
  plotting/sampling raw rows; locale-aware number parsing (EU `1.234,56`); data labels on bars.

## Tech shape

Static single-page app: Vite + vanilla TypeScript + one lean chart library
(Chart.js vs D3 — decide at build time, log the choice in DECISIONS.md).
PapaParse for CSV parsing. GitHub Pages deploy. No backend.
